**USER STORIES**

1. As an analyst at the organization, I want to view a list of all countries cities, and capitals in the world organized by largest population to smallest, so that I can understand global population distribution.

2. As a policy planner at the organization, I want to generate dynamic reports 
showing the top N populated countries or cities where N is provided by me, so 
that I can target policy initiatives based on population size.
